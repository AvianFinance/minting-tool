# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```


const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc")
const signer_m = new ethers.Wallet("7e0dd21cba3952c769b9a90376893a351d4ac356aeacd0e537f5022e08593528", provider); // Meelan Credentials
